var alpaca = '"But why alpacas?" you might just ask yourself. The answer is simple. ' + 
'Alpacas have been domesticated for thousands of years. The Moche people of northern Peru often used alpaca images in their art. '+
'There are no known wild alpacas, and its closest living relative, the vicu単a (also native to South America), are believed to be the wild ancestor of the alpaca. ' +
'The alpaca is larger than the vicu単a, but smaller than the other camelid species. ' +
'Along with camels and llamas, alpacas are classified as camelids. Of the various camelid species, the alpaca and vicu単a are the most valuable fiber-bearing animals: ' +
'the alpaca because of the quality and quantity of its fiber, and the vicu単a because of the softness, fineness and quality of its coat.' +
'Alpacas are too small to be used as pack animals. Instead, they are bred exclusively for their fiber and meat. Alpaca meat was once considered a ' + 
'delicacy by Andean inhabitants. Because of the high price commanded by alpaca on the growing North American market, illegal alpaca smuggling had become a growing problem as of 2005.' + 
'In 2014, a company was formed claiming to be the first to export US-derived alpaca products to China.' +
'Alpacas and llamas can successfully cross-breed. The resulting offspring are called huarizo, which are valued for their unique fleece and gentle dispositions.';
